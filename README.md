## About me

I graduated with a degree in Information Systems last year and am passionate about quality assurance and software testing. I enjoy exploring various testing methodologies and am committed to expanding my expertise by learning the latest testing techniques. 

My focus is on enhancing my analytical skills to identify issues early and contribute to developing reliable, high-quality software products. I’m driven by a desire to improve user experiences and ensure product stability, making me eager to contribute to projects where quality and precision are paramount.

I’m eager to deepen my knowledge in automation testing to broaden my expertise beyond manual testing. With my current focus on manual testing, I see the potential to enhance testing efficiency, coverage, and consistency through automation. I’m motivated to learn the tools and frameworks necessary to streamline repetitive tasks, allowing for faster and more reliable testing processes. This transition will enable me to contribute even more effectively to high-quality software development.
